<h2>About</h2>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage.</p>
  <p>My name is Karolis Dembickas, since September 2025, I am a PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~meier007/">Lennart Meier</a> at the Mathematical Institute at Utrecht University. Before, I was a Masters student in Mathematical Physics at the University of Hamburg working under the supervision of Ingo Runkel. I am interested in homotopy theory with an eye towards mathematical physics. In my free time, you can find me bouldering at the local bouldering gym.</p>
